# Build and measure a persistent LLM/decision-model stream clusterer

Status: In Progress
Branch: feat-stream-clustering
Session: 01a15732-077c-7a33-ba98-e8b2509c6a74 (Codex)

## Goal

Implement a standalone Rust clusterer with a single SQLite state file. Compare
gpt-6.1-sol high ordinary assignments with gpt-6-luna decisions; both use Sol high
for cluster creation/maintenance. Publish BSD source and reproducible measurements
for 1,000 text inputs and 100 images. Publish the illustrated report separately
as edwardbenson.com's goofing/ld-clustering page.

## Plan

- Verify provider contract/prices and primary-source clustering literature.
- Prepare licensed deterministic text and image datasets with hidden eval labels.
- Pin bounded choices/Other, assignment persistence and maintenance invariants
  using offline tests, then implement state, stream processing and providers.
- Record request/response payloads, usage, elapsed time and computed token costs.
- Smoke-test live APIs; execute complete independent streaming arms and a
  controlled frozen-catalog comparison if needed to separate catalog divergence.
- Compute label-invariant baseline agreement and secondary label metrics; report
  actual counts, failures, outliers, shared overhead and limits.
- Simplify, test, lint, publish eob repository, and release evidence plus report.

## Acceptance criteria

- At most K cluster alternatives and Other in every model assignment call.
- Novelty buffer and configurable cluster cap govern cluster growth.
- Merge, split, rename and retire can revise assignments; Other always exists.
- Atomic SQLite maintenance and restartable stream processing preserve every point.
- No labels or upstream category names enter model evidence.
- Exactly 1,000 text and 100 image points per full arm; incomplete runs cannot be
  reported as complete. Raw evidence, dataset hashes and model/pricing pins survive.
- Source, offline tests, CLI documentation and real cost/time/agreement artifacts.

## Research brief

Question: Does replacing assignment-time Sol calls with the OpenAI Decisions API
retain agreement with an LLM-only stream clusterer while reducing total cost and
elapsed time, including shared LLM planning and maintenance?
Hypotheses: decisions may agree well and reduce assignment cost; planning may
dominate total cost; divergent early decisions may change the cluster catalogs;
image inputs may differ from text. One run cannot establish universal quality or
latency. Public benchmark labels are a secondary check, not the baseline truth.

## Current state

Rust state, engine, provider, dataset preparation, metrics, comparison CLI and
benchmark runner are implemented. Public repository initialized at
https://github.com/eob/ld-clustering. Dataset preparation verified 1,000 text and
100 image points with license/source pins. Six paid protocol smoke calls passed;
the complete measured experiments have not started yet. The website is built in
its separate Kaya worktree and still displays pending results honestly.

Independent review demonstrated a journal/database association defect in the
initial comparison code using a wrong shared journal. Bind journals to runs and
verify coverage of successful SQLite calls before freezing the experiment code.
Mark timing incomplete on recovery from an unclean process exit; do not silently
report a resumed segment as the original full elapsed duration.

## Validation evidence

Initial store maintenance regression (before implementation),
`cargo test --lib store::tests::maintenance_creates_clusters_and_queues_other -- --exact`:

```text
---- store::tests::maintenance_creates_clusters_and_queues_other stdout ----
Error: maintenance is not implemented
test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 3 filtered out
```

Bounded assignment Red:

```text
---- engine::tests::bounded_pages_visit_every_candidate_until_a_match stdout ----
Error: bounded assignment is not implemented
test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 14 filtered out
```

Initial full gate: `cargo test` 24 passed, 1 explicitly paid-live test ignored;
`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed; release binary built. Source
base is initial repository commit 6345fcd, before the experimental implementation
commit. Provider/research tickets retain scoped red and live smoke evidence.
